Jenni was born on May 27th, 1982 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada and was raised alongside her two older siblings by their parents Jim Neidhart and Ellie Hart. After graduating high school she went on to study broadcast journalism at university. But it wasn’t until 2006 that Jenni began training to become a professional wrestler under her uncle Bruce Hart and his son Teddy Hart. 
In 2007 Jenni made her official debut with WWE's developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) as "Anvilette". She rose through the ranks quickly, earning championships and recognition from her peers in both singles and tag team competition before being called up to join the main roster in 2008. In 2009 she changed her name from Anvilette to Natalya Neidhart, later shortened to just Natalya. 
From there Jenni began making an impressive impact throughout WWE's women's division – winning numerous championships across all three brands (Raw, SmackDown Live and NXT). In 2011 she became one of the first females to compete in a lumberjill match at WrestleMania 27 against then Divas Champion Layla. In 2015 she also became one of five female wrestlers to be featured in WWE 2K17 video game – making history once more as it was the first time women had been included in a wrestling game since 2000! 

Throughout her career with WWE Jenni has put female wrestlers on a newfound pedestal; not only collecting championship after championship but also inspiring upcoming generations of female wrestlers with her infectious enthusiasm and hard work ethic. She is often referred to as “The Queen Of Harts” due to both her lineage and performance within WWE – becoming one of its most decorated female competitors ever with eight total championship reigns throughout Raw, SmackDown Live & NXT combined! 

Outside of wrestling Jenni has continued to make waves through charity work; founding “Natalya’s Fashion Boutique” which sells gently-used clothing for local charities supporting victims of domestic violence or struggling families – donating all proceeds from this project towards helping those less fortunate than herself! Additionally she has worked with organizations such as Make-A-Wish Foundation as well as travelling around various countries teaching self-defence seminars geared towards young girls & women’s empowerment! 

It’s clear that Jenni Neidhart will continue making an impact both inside & outside of wrestling for many years to come – cementing herself as an inspirational role model for those looking</p><br><p>Written by: JuvelAdmin</p><p>Date: 2023-01-16</p>
